The tools used in this assignment was the Tailwind. It had seemed easy to use in the beginning but during the bulding process I had to study a little deeper about it to understand better how the tool worked and its features. I realized that I will have to do more projects using this too to get moe familiar with all the options offered by the tool. I have chosen this tool inspite the Boostrap because it was the first on that I got familiar in class.
I got confused about the display of some folders and I got some help from Fesal.
I wish have more time to go deeper with the Tailwind Documentation and improve the webpage.
